<p>Just a lost windrunner who spends too much his time wasting it, mostly due to my obsession with Linux and ricing. Along with, of course, a good peach and chocolate covered almonds, nothing wastes time like those do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fjords+of+norway&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Fjords of Norway</a> but recently discovered the beauty of places like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iceland+mountains&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Iceland</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=baffin+island&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Baffin Island</a>, both of which are making my bucket list seem quite expensive.</p>
<p>Gaming was a big thing for me a while ago but I find it kind of meh now, I&rsquo;ve come to prefer doing more productive things, though I will admit that some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/">Hollow Knight</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/">Terraria</a> from time to time is a nice getaway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the kind of guy who eats grapes straight from the vine and will use the smallest spoon available when eating something he likes. I don&rsquo;t know if that says anything about me but I hope it does. I learn by teaching and teach by scolding, it&rsquo;s worked for me so far and I hope it keeps doing so.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t met Money in a while now, she doesn&rsquo;t exactly get along well with me, but that&rsquo;s fine, Loneliness was always more my type.</p>
